Our project name is Wikipedia Article Recommendation. Wikipedia Article
Recommendation is an implementation project that contains the following categories: Graph and Graph
Algorithms, Information Networks, Document Search, and Advanced topics (PageRank). Our project
is an interactive Java program that prompts the user for a source URL from Wikipedia,
and recommends popular articles based on this source URL and a few other user-inputted parameters.
These parameters are a search distance k, the number of links sampled per page n, and a number of
recommended articles r. Because visiting each link on each Wikipedia page would take too long,
we randomly sample n links on each page instead, and we continue the BFS on each page until
we have hit k links away from the source URL. After visiting each page, the program calculates
the PageRank for each article, and outputs the r articles with the highest PageRank as
recommendations.

The work breakdown goes as follows. Joseph and Vongdara parsed the user input and connected to
the source URL to get a list of articles. Joseph ran BFS from the source URL and created a
directed edge list of articles that are at most k distance from the source URL. Alessandro
developed and ran the PageRank algorithm, and Alessandro and Vongdara worked on returning
the top articles based on their PageRank and the user input.
